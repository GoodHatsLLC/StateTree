# TicTacToe

TicTacToe is a common example app in both iOS framworks and wider app development,
and so a useful opportunity for comparison:

The StateTree TicTacToe example app showcases:
* A moderately complicated SwiftUIâ€”StateTree integration.
* Reasonable unit tests for StateTree logic.
* The StateTree `PlaybackView` which provides:
  - State recording
  - State playback
  - Behavior (i.e. side effect) recording
  - JSON state printing
