/// A `Projection` references a value whose source of truth is elsewhere.
///
/// The underlying referenced value is represented by an ``Accessor`` which
/// is back by either:
/// - A ``Value`` owned by a ``Node`` which is an ancestor to the one
///   containing the `Projection`.
/// - Or more rarely a closure capturing a value.
///
/// A `Projection` in StateTree serves the same purpose as a `Binding` in SwiftUI.
/// It allows a parent `Node` to share state with a child.
///
/// > Important: Shared state should have a clear contract. If multiple nodes react to shared
/// state changes in conflicting ways they may create a circular dependency in their combined
/// reaction logic. StateTree will detect and revert the state change triggering the circular
/// dependencyâ€”but that's likely to be a costly process with a poor end-user  uexperience.
